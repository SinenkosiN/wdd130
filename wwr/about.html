            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Our website was created to bring the excitement of Durban’s river adventures to a wider audience. What
                began as a small
                local rafting operation grew as more people discovered the beauty of the uMngeni River and the thrill of
                guided rafting
                experiences. To meet this demand, we launched our online platform—making it easier for customers to
                explore our
                packages, learn about safety, and book unforgettable adventures. Over the years, the site has evolved
                with improved
                features, updated content, and a commitment to showcasing the best of Durban’s outdoor spirit. Today, it
                stands as a
                trusted gateway for families, adventurers, and corporate teams looking to experience rafting at its
                finest.</p>
