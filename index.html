        <p>South Africa is a country on the southernmost tip of the African continent, marked by several distinct
            ecosystems.
            Inland safari destination Kruger National Park is populated by big game. The Western Cape offers beaches,
            lush winelands
            around Stellenbosch and Paarl, craggy cliffs at the Cape of Good Hope, forest and lagoons along the Garden
            Route, and
            the city of Cape Town, beneath flat-topped Table Mountain.</p>
